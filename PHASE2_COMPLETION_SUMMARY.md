## What Was Implemented

Phase 2 introduced the core data structures needed for symmetric bidirectional mesh repair. These structures enable the system to:

1. **Store bidirectional classifications** - preserve results from both A→B and B→A perspectives
2. **Make local repair decisions** - each edge independently chooses optimal strategy
3. **Build a unified third mesh** - that satisfies constraints from both sides
4. **Track provenance** - know which mesh (A or B) contributed each triangle

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Union Types for Optional Classifications

```julia
classification_A_perspective::Union{EdgeMismatch, Nothing}
classification_B_perspective::Union{EdgeMismatch, Nothing}
```

**Rationale**: An edge may exist only in A or only in B, so one classification may be `nothing`. This explicit optionality makes the code safer and more self-documenting.

### 2. Node Mapping via Coordinates

```julia
node_mapping_A::Dict{NTuple{3,Float64}, Union{Int, Nothing}}
node_mapping_B::Dict{NTuple{3,Float64}, Union{Int, Nothing}}
```

**Rationale**: The same geometric location may have different node IDs in A and B. Coordinate-based mapping allows the unified mesh to reference both original meshes correctly. `Nothing` indicates a new node not present in the original mesh.

### 3. Triangle Provenance Tracking

```julia
triangle_provenance::Vector{Symbol}  # :from_A | :from_B | :synthesized
```

**Rationale**: For debugging and analysis, it's valuable to know where each triangle in the unified mesh came from. This helps identify which repair strategies were most successful.

### 4. Flattened Triangle Format

```julia
result_triangles::Vector{NTuple{9,Float64}}
```

**Rationale**: Storing triangles as 9-tuples (v1_x, v1_y, v1_z, v2_x, v2_y, v2_z, v3_x, v3_y, v3_z) simplifies serialization and matches the format used in existing repair plans. Conversion utilities are provided.

### 5. Automatic Presence/Agreement Computation

```julia
function SymmetricEdgeMismatch(edge_key, class_A, class_B, strategy, priority, reason)
    # Automatically compute:
    # - present_in_A, present_in_B, present_in_both
    # - agree_on_type, agree_on_feasibility
    # ...
end
```

**Rationale**: Reduces boilerplate and prevents inconsistencies. Users provide classifications and strategy; the constructor computes derived fields automatically.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Creating a SymmetricEdgeMismatch

```julia
using Nas2Step

# Edge that exists only in mesh A
edge_key = EdgeKey((0.0, 0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0, 0.0))

# A's perspective: T-junction, feasible
mismatch_A = classify_edge_mismatch(edge_key, topology, :A)

# B doesn't have this edge
mismatch_B = nothing

# Create symmetric mismatch
sym = SymmetricEdgeMismatch(
    edge_key,
    mismatch_A,
    mismatch_B,
    :use_A,  # Strategy: use A's triangulation
    0.7,     # Priority: medium-high
    "Edge from A is feasible with good quality"
)

# Access computed fields
println("Present in A: $(sym.present_in_A)")  # true
println("Present in B: $(sym.present_in_B)")  # false
println("Present in both: $(sym.present_in_both)")  # false
println("Strategy: $(sym.repair_strategy)")  # :use_A
```

### Example 2: Building a UnifiedInterfaceMesh

```julia
# Create empty mesh
unified = UnifiedInterfaceMesh()

# Add triangles (incrementally)
push!(unified.triangles, triangle1)
push!(unified.triangles, triangle2)
push!(unified.triangle_provenance, :from_A)
push!(unified.triangle_provenance, :from_B)

# Build node mappings
for tri in unified.triangles
    for coord in [tri.coord1, tri.coord2, tri.coord3]
        # Map to A's node ID
        unified.node_mapping_A[coord] = find_node_id_in_A(coord)
        # Map to B's node ID
        unified.node_mapping_B[coord] = find_node_id_in_B(coord)
    end
end

# Compute quality
unified.min_triangle_quality = minimum(tri.quality for tri in unified.triangles)
unified.total_area = sum(tri.area for tri in unified.triangles)
```

### Example 3: Creating a UnifiedMeshOperation

```julia
# Copy triangulation from mesh A
operation = UnifiedMeshOperation(
    :copy_from_A,               # Operation type
    boundary_nodes,             # Nodes defining region
    [tri1_A, tri2_A],          # Source triangles from A
    Triangle[],                 # No B triangles
    [flatten_triangle(tri1_A),  # Result triangles (flattened)
     flatten_triangle(tri2_A)],
    0.45,                       # Min quality
    true,                       # Feasible
    "A's triangulation has better quality"
)
```

### Example 4: Strategy Counting

```julia
# Given a list of symmetric mismatches
sym_mismatches = [...]  # Vector{SymmetricEdgeMismatch}

# Count by strategy
counts = count_by_strategy(sym_mismatches)

println("Using A's triangulation: $(counts[:use_A])")
println("Using B's triangulation: $(counts[:use_B])")
println("Compromise needed: $(counts[:compromise])")
println("Skipping: $(counts[:skip])")

# Compute agreement statistics
stats = compute_agreement_statistics(sym_mismatches)

println("Total edges: $(stats.total)")
println("Agreement rate: $(round(stats.agreement_rate * 100, digits=1))%")
println("Edges in both: $(stats.both_present)")
println("Agree on type: $(stats.agree_on_type)")
println("Agree on feasibility: $(stats.agree_on_feasibility)")
```

## Integration Points

### With Existing Code

These new types are designed to integrate with:

1. **`InterfaceTopology`** (from `interface_topology.jl`)
   - Provides face and edge data for both A and B
   - Used as input to symmetric classification

2. **`EdgeMismatch`** (from `edge_classification.jl`)
   - `SymmetricEdgeMismatch` wraps two `EdgeMismatch` instances
   - One for A→B perspective, one for B→A perspective

3. **`BoundaryConstraints`** (from `boundary_constraints.jl`)
   - Used to check feasibility of repair operations
   - Unified mesh must satisfy constraints from both sides

4. **`Triangle`** (from `interface_topology.jl`)
   - `UnifiedInterfaceMesh` stores `Triangle` instances
   - Utility functions convert between `Triangle` and flat tuples

### With Future Code (Phases 3-7)

1. **Phase 3**: Classification will populate `SymmetricEdgeMismatch` instances
2. **Phase 4**: Strategy selection will set `repair_strategy` and `repair_priority`
3. **Phase 5**: Mesh generation will build `UnifiedInterfaceMesh` from operations
4. **Phase 6**: Replacement will use node mappings to install unified mesh
5. **Phase 7**: Execution will orchestrate the entire symmetric repair process

## Testing Strategy

The test suite (`test/test_symmetric_repair_types.jl`) validates:

✅ **Structure construction** - All types can be created correctly  
✅ **Convenience constructors** - Simplified construction works  
✅ **Field computation** - Automatic presence/agreement calculation  
✅ **Node mapping semantics** - Handles A-only, B-only, and shared nodes  
✅ **Utility functions** - Counting, statistics, conversions  
✅ **Edge cases** - Empty meshes, no classifications, etc.

To run tests (when module is loaded):
```bash
julia --project=. test/test_symmetric_repair_types.jl
```

---

## Documentation Quality

All data structures include:
- **Comprehensive docstrings** with field descriptions
- **Usage examples** showing typical construction patterns
- **Semantic explanations** of what each field means
- **Cross-references** to related types and functions

Example docstring structure:
```julia
"""
    SymmetricEdgeMismatch

Complete bidirectional classification for a single edge mismatch.

# Fields
- `edge_key::EdgeKey`: The edge being classified
- ...

# Classification Perspective Meanings
- **A perspective** (A→B): "This edge exists in A, is missing in B..."
- ...

# Example
```julia
sym = SymmetricEdgeMismatch(...)
```
"""
```

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **Memory efficiency**: Uses `Union{T, Nothing}` instead of `Option` type
2. **Lookup efficiency**: Node mappings use `Dict` for O(1) coordinate lookup
3. **Lazy computation**: Fields computed only when needed (e.g., quality)
4. **Flat triangles**: Reduces allocations for serialization

---

## Next Steps

With Phase 2 complete, we can proceed to:

### ✅ Phase 3: Bidirectional Classification Enhancement
- Implement `classify_interface_mismatches_symmetric()`
- Populate `SymmetricEdgeMismatch` instances from both perspectives
- Compute agreement metrics

### Phase 4: Local Repair Strategy Selection
- Implement `determine_repair_strategy()`
- Select optimal strategy per edge
- Assign priorities

### Phase 5: Third Mesh Generation
- Implement `generate_unified_interface_mesh()`
- Apply operations to build unified mesh
- Handle conflicts and gaps
