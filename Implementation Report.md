# What’s already implemented (mapped to the plan)

## Phase 2: New data structures

Implemented: SymmetricEdgeMismatch, UnifiedInterfaceMesh, UnifiedMeshOperation, SymmetricRepairPlan, plus SymmetricClassificationResult and utilities in symmetric_repair_types.jl.

## Phase 3: Symmetric classification

Implemented: classify_interface_mismatches_symmetric in symmetric_classification.jl preserves both perspectives and returns SymmetricClassificationResult. Agreement metrics and JSON export/summary are present.
Note: helper update_symmetric_mismatches_with_strategies! is a placeholder.
Phase 4: Local strategy selection

Implemented: determine_repair_strategy and apply_strategy_selection! in symmetric_strategy_selection.jl with priority logic and analysis helpers.

## Phase 6: Mesh replacement operations

Implemented (largely): replace_both_interfaces! and execute_symmetric_repair! in repair_execution.jl.
Workspace utilities present in repair_workspace.jl: begin_transaction!, commit_transaction!, rollback_transaction!, delete_interface_face!, map_nodes_to_pid, verify_mesh_integrity, get_or_create_node!.

## Phase 7: Execution pipeline

Partially implemented: build_symmetric_repair_plan and orchestration hooks in repair_orchestration.jl select symmetric vs traditional paths.
Bidirectional foundation (legacy)

Present: classify_interface_mismatches_bidirectional in edge_classification.jl and generate_repair_plan_bidirectional in repair_planning.jl.
Tests

Present but skeletal: test_phase6_mesh_replacement.jl and test_symmetric_repair_types.jl (the former mostly placeholders).

# Implementation gaps to fill

## A. Phase 5: Third mesh generation algorithm

Status: Implemented MVP with targeted enhancements.

Delivered in `src/repair/unified_mesh_generation.jl` and wired via `build_symmetric_repair_plan`:
- Strategy-driven triangle selection (:use_A/:use_B)
- De-duplication via rounded coordinate signatures
- Conflict guard: non-manifold edge avoidance (edge incidence ≤ 2)
- Node mappings from `topology.node_key_to_ids`
- Edge topology construction and triangle provenance tracking
- Metrics: min quality (via `compute_triangle_quality`) and total area
- Compatibility check: edge-coverage vs A/B with threshold
- Gap detection and fill: boundary loop detection + centroid-fan triangulation
- Fallback: minimal shared-triangle inclusion if selection empty

Remaining enhancements (deferred):
- Boundary consistency hardening and report detail
- Overlap detection/resolution beyond the incidence guard
- Compromise synthesis (:compromise strategy)
- Richer compatibility (boundary loops equivalence, orientation)

## B. Orchestration wiring and type mismatches (runtime bugs)
Misuse of return type in orchestrate_single_interface_repair:
Code treats classify_interface_mismatches_symmetric(topology) as if it returns a Vector, but it returns SymmetricClassificationResult.
Fixed:
`classify_interface_mismatches_symmetric` result handled correctly; use `result.symmetric_mismatches`.
Wrong build_interface_topology signature usage:
Fixed to pass the NAS file path: `build_interface_topology(mesh_file, pid_a, pid_b)`.
Placeholder/incorrect build_interface_topology_from_workspace:
Returns InterfaceTopology(...) with too few args for the struct; will throw at runtime if executed.
Fix: either implement a proper from-workspace topology builder that populates all fields or avoid calling this until ready.

## C. Phase 6: Mesh replacement path completeness issues
Plan preflight vs current behavior:

replace_both_interfaces! correctly rejects empty/unverified unified meshes. Since build_symmetric_repair_plan provides a default empty UnifiedInterfaceMesh() with compatible_with_* = false, any symmetric execution will currently reject replacement.
Now feasible: Unified mesh is generated by Phase 5; plan feasibility computed from compatibility and non-empty triangles. Replacement path can proceed for simple cases.
Workspace export and constructor gaps:

export_modified_mesh(ws) references ws.original_mesh, but RepairWorkspace doesn’t store this field (it stores original_file). This will error if called.
execute_repairs_from_json uses RepairWorkspace(mesh) but only RepairWorkspace(mesh_file::String) exists.
Fix:
Add original_mesh to workspace or rewrite export_modified_mesh to reconstruct a mesh from working_nodes/working_faces.
Add RepairWorkspace(mesh) overload or adjust callers to pass the file path.

## D. Phase 4 integration inconsistencies
Duplicate/unused strategy updater:

update_symmetric_mismatches_with_strategies! is a placeholder and isn’t used.
Prefer using the already-implemented apply_strategy_selection! or remove the placeholder to avoid confusion.
Plan vs naming mismatch:

Plan mentions generate_symmetric_repair_plan; code uses build_symmetric_repair_plan.
Not functionally blocking, but align names or document the divergence.

## E. Unidirectional repair execution issues (cleanup)
Field name mismatch in logging:

In apply_repair_plan!, logging uses edge_plan.plan_type, but the struct has split_type.
Fix: log split_type.
Potential unsupported direction:

RepairPlan.repair_direction includes :mutual in the type docstring, but apply_repair_plan! errors on anything except :subdivide_A/:subdivide_B.
Fix: handle or disallow :mutual explicitly.
JSON plan loader out of date:

load_repair_plan_from_json constructs EdgeInsertionPlan with fields (plan_type, triangles_to_replace, new_triangles, etc.) that don’t match the current struct.
Fix: update loader to match EdgeInsertionPlan fields/semantics or remove if deprecated.

## F. Symmetric types and classification details
Correspondence finder:

find_corresponding_mismatch_in_swapped matches by EdgeKey equality (rounded), which is OK, but if edge key creation deviates anywhere, this will miss matches. Keep consistent key creation policy (already documented in interface_topology.jl).
Strategy “pending” state:

classify_interface_mismatches_symmetric seeds :pending strategy; either immediately apply apply_strategy_selection! in orchestration or keep a clear pipeline step for it.

## G. Testing gaps (Phase 8)
Present but placeholders:
test_phase6_mesh_replacement.jl contains placeholder tests (@test true) instead of real assertions.
Missing coverage:
No tests for classify_interface_mismatches_symmetric, agreement analysis, determine_repair_strategy, or end-to-end symmetric pathways.
Action (deferred per request):
- Add unit tests for classification scenarios (A-only, B-only, both with agreement/disagreement).
- Add unit tests for strategy selection decision branches.
- Add integration tests for unified generator (edge coverage, gap fill, conflict guard) and replacement.

## H. API/exports hygiene (Phase 9)
Exports mostly aligned; however:
No exported function named generate_symmetric_repair_plan as in the plan; either export build_symmetric_repair_plan or add the alias implementation.
Consider exposing a minimal “symmetric repair” top-level API that runs: topology → symmetric classification → strategy selection → unified mesh generation → replacement → validation.

# Quick, low-risk fixes to unblock progress
- Fix orchestration to handle SymmetricClassificationResult correctly and pass file path to build_interface_topology.
- Fix apply_repair_plan! logging field (split_type).
- Add a no-op MVP generate_unified_interface_mesh that:
  - For edges marked :use_A, copies triangles from A for those regions (even if coarse).
  - Flags compatible_with_A/B = true and returns at least one triangle for a trivial case to exercise the replacement path.
    - Wire it into build_symmetric_repair_plan to populate target_unified_mesh and set is_feasible honestly (until conflict/gap logic lands).
- Update export_modified_mesh or workspace fields to be consistent.
- Replace or remove the outdated JSON loader (or annotate as deprecated).


# Requirements coverage
- Phase 2 (types): Done.
- Phase 3 (symmetric classification and keep both perspectives): Done.
- Phase 4 (strategy selection): Done; integration needs minor cleanup.
- Phase 5 (unified mesh generation): Deferred — core algorithm and helpers missing.
- Phase 6 (replacement operations): Implemented; usable once Phase 5 supplies a valid unified mesh.
- Phase 7 (pipeline): Partially wired; contains type/signature bugs and relies on Phase 5.
- Phase 8 (tests): Partial; substantive tests missing.
- Phase 9 (migration/back-compat): Partial; old API present, new symmetric API mostly in place but naming and top-level entry point could be tightened.


# Suggested next steps
+ Strengthen compatibility verification (boundary loop equivalence, orientation consistency), improve report detail.
+ Implement overlap/coverage resolution beyond the simple incidence guard.
+ Add :compromise synthesis path for mixed strategies.
+ Add focused tests to lock behavior (when testing is re-enabled).

# Milestones and risks (execution-focused)

Milestones (short, actionable):
- M1: Compatibility hardening
  - Boundary loop equivalence check against A and B
  - Orientation consistency validation (normal coherence)
  - Acceptance: end-to-end symmetric replacement succeeds on examples/box and examples/torus
- M2: Overlap/coverage resolution
  - Detect overlapping triangles and locally prune or retriangulate
  - Fill partial gaps while respecting incidence ≤ 2
  - Acceptance: no non-manifold edges; coverage ≥ 70% vs both sides
- M3: Compromise synthesis
  - Implement :compromise path with simple Delaunay-on-merged-boundary fallback
  - Acceptance: mixed-strategy interfaces build without fallback-to-A/B
- M4: Reporting and UX
  - Richer compatibility_report with per-issue counts and examples
  - CLI printouts in orchestration for pass/fail with reasons

Key risks and mitigations:
- Risk: Centroid-fan gap fill introduces sliver triangles
  - Mitigation: minimum angle threshold; skip poor-quality tris; consider local planar projection
- Risk: False compatibility due to edge coverage alone
  - Mitigation: add boundary-loop equality and orientation checks (M1)
- Risk: Overlaps from mixing A/B patches
  - Mitigation: track triangle-plane overlap heuristics; prune lowest-quality in conflicts (M2)
- Risk: Performance on large interfaces
  - Mitigation: use rounded keys and adjacency maps; lazy conflict checks; optional verbose off
